# Self-Hosting Guide

The project intends to not provide any cloud solution (yet). Hence if you want to use it for your portfolio then you need to host it yourself on either your own infra or any of the many available 3rd party cloud solutions.

## 3rd Party Solutions

Since this app is built with [Remix](https://remix.run/), this app can be deployed with all the [adapters remix can support](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/other-api/adapter).
