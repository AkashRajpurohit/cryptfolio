## Motivation 💪
I started exploring cryptocurrencies a year back and started with Binance (suggested by a friend). However, unlike my [other investment tools](https://akashrajpurohit.com/uses/#finance), I found it quite difficult to track my portfolio so I thought of creating a simplified version of it.

Also, I was looking into [Remix](https://remix.run/) at that time so took this project as an opportunity to explore Remix because why not?
